# Chapter 2 - Intro to OS

Von Neumann model of computing is descibed as fetch(instruction from memory) - deocdes (figure out instruction) - executes

## 2.1 Virtualize the CPU

The OS is a resource manager for all the physical resources of the system (memory, CPU, etc.)

## 2.2 

The OS virtualizes memory. Each process accesses its own private virtual address space (address space) which the OS maps onto the physical memory

The idea of memory is abstracted for programs (it does not assume its really sharing any memory)

## 2.3 Concurrency
